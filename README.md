### Imperative SwiftUI

Activity for Swift Mumbai Talk - 24th May 2025

This code is written an extremely imperative manner. Let's make it more declarative by using: 

1. State & Binding objects
2. View Modifiers or View Extensions
3. Environment objects
4. Generic types

That's all! Thank you for stopping by :)
